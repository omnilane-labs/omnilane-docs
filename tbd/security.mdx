# Security

At Omnilane, the security of our users and their assets is a top priority. We implement robust security measures and utilize advanced technologies to ensure that every transaction on our platform is secure, transparent, and reliable. Below, we outline the key security features that make Omnilane a trusted choice for cross-chain swaps.

## Chain Signatures Technology

**Decentralized Settlement Layer**: Omnilane leverages the NEAR blockchain's Chain Signatures technology, which allows smart contracts to sign and execute transactions across multiple blockchains. This decentralized settlement layer eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries, reducing potential single points of failure and enhancing the overall security of the platform.

**Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**: Our use of MPC technology ensures that the private keys needed to authorize transactions are never exposed or controlled by a single entity. This distributed approach protects against key compromise and unauthorized access, making it a secure method for cross-chain asset swaps.

## Protection Against MEV Attacks

**RFQ Model**: Omnilane uses a Request for Quote (RFQ) model to safeguard against Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks, a common issue in traditional DEX environments. The RFQ model provides users with a guaranteed rate for their swap, ensuring that they receive exactly what is quoted without unexpected slippage or front-running by miners.

## Transparency and Auditability

**Public and Transparent Ledger**: All transactions on Omnilane are recorded on the blockchain, providing a public and immutable ledger. This transparency allows users and auditors to verify transactions, enhancing trust and accountability within the platform.

**Smart Contract Audits**: Our smart contracts undergo rigorous security audits by third-party experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We continuously monitor and update our smart contracts to maintain the highest standards of security.

## User Privacy and Control

**Non-Custodial Platform**: Omnilane is a non-custodial platform, meaning we do not hold or control users' funds at any point. Users maintain full control over their assets throughout the transaction process, reducing the risk of asset loss due to hacks or mismanagement.

**Data Privacy**: We prioritize user privacy and do not require personal information for using our platform. Omnilane operates without KYC requirements, ensuring that users can trade with anonymity and confidence.

## Continuous Security Enhancements

**Regular Updates**: We are committed to continuously enhancing our security protocols to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Our team actively monitors the security landscape and implements updates as necessary to safeguard our platform and users.

**Community and Bug Bounties**: We encourage our community to participate in our security efforts by reporting bugs and vulnerabilities. Our bug bounty program rewards individuals who help us maintain the security and integrity of Omnilane.

At Omnilane, we believe that security is a continuous journey, and we are dedicated to building a platform that users can trust. Our comprehensive security measures and transparent practices are designed to provide peace of mind and protect our users' assets at every step.
