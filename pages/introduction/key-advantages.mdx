# Key Advantages

Omnilane is a next-generation infrastructure for decentralized cross-chain swaps, offering several key advantages over other solutions:

**Less Parties to Incentivize or Trust:** Omnilane operates without relying on oracles, bridges, sidechains, or other intermediaries to facilitate cross-chain swaps or bridges. This significantly reduces the number of third parties involved. As a result, the system is not only more secure but also simpler, faster and more cost-effective.

**Price Certainty & Protection from Common Issues:** Traditional protocols that rely on Automated Market Makers (AMMs) face a range of problems that negatively impact user experience, particularly in a cross-chain context:
- *Slippage:* The execution price can deviate from the spot price due to the size of the order being executed.
- *Price Uncertainty:* The spot price may change between the time a user initiates a trade and the time it is finalized on-chain.
- *MEV & Sandwich Attack:* Users are vulnerable to malicious actors front-running or manipulating transactions for profit, forcing inefficient trades.

These issues become even more pronounced in cross-chain operations, where the time between order placement and execution increases. Omnilane avoids these problems by using a peer-to-peer limit order model, ensuring trades are executed at or above the requested price, providing users with price certainty and protection from MEV attacks.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Omnilaneâ€™s streamlined architecture allows for significantly lower base fees compared to other solutions. This means that apps can integrate Omnilane and offer competitive swap prices while still making a healthy profit on the trades, ensuring a cost-efficient experience for both users and integrators.

**User Experience:** Omnilane provides a Uniswap-like user experience across all supported chains, maintaining full decentralization. Users enjoy a familiar interface and seamless cross-chain functionality without compromising on security or decentralization.

**Speed:** Trades on Omnilane are executed swiftly, without requiring waiting for cross-chain finality. Liquidity providers compete to settle trades as quickly as possible, often achieving near-instant execution times, as fast as NEAR's 1-second block time.

**Ready-to-Use Liquidity:** Omnilane comes with a built-in liquidity layer, eliminating the need for integration partners to source liquidity independently. This simplifies the integration process and ensures ready-to-use liquidity for cross-chain swaps.

**Easiest Integration:** Integrating Omnilane is straightforward, requiring only a single function call to a smart contract. Partners do not need to worry about managing liquidity, building cross-chain infrastructure, or maintaining the system. Omnilane handles all of that.

**Fair Revenue Sharing:** Omnilane offers a generous revenue-sharing model for integration partners. Partners can earn a significant portion of the fees generated by their users. Early adopters, can earn up to 50% of protocol fees plus any additional vendor fees they choose to implement.
