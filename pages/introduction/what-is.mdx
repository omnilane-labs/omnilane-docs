# What is Omnilane?

## Introduction

Omnilane is building [intent-based](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-labs-and-across-propose-standard-for-cross-chain-intents) decentralized infrastructure for swapping and bridging across any chain. Unlike traditional swap protocols, Omnilane doesnâ€™t have a frontend, instead, we focus on building the core infrastructure for cross-chain swaps and bridges so that other projects can leverage our technology to build or integrate within their own frontend applications.

We have developed a propietary algorithm called **Cumulative State Consensus** that leverages the innovative [Chain Signatures](https://docs.near.org/build/chain-abstraction/chain-signatures) technology on the NEAR blockchain and allows users to swap/bridge across chains without using oracles, bridges, sidechains, etc.

Any wallet, DEX, or dApp can integrate Omnilane in the backend, saving time and resources on building the best cross-chain swap tech and focusing on building the best user experience. Also, dApps that integrate Omnilane don't need to worry about gathering liquidity, as all the swap/bridge operations that go through Omnilane are settled by our liquidity providers.

Because of our superior decentralized technology, our low base fees, and our fair integration program, Omnilane is simply the best option for any project looking to integrate cross-chain swaps/bridges in their application.

## Examples of Integrations

1. **Wallets / Hardware Wallets**: Wallets struggle to monetize their user base, and Omnilane provides a new revenue stream for wallets by enabling cross-chain swaps and bridges. Wallets can integrate Omnilane in the backend and earn a big percentage of the fees generated by their users.

2. **DEXes**: DEXes can integrate Omnilane in the backend and offer cross-chain swaps and bridges to their users, expanding their services and monetizing other actions from their users. This will allow DEXes to offer a better user experience and attract more users.

3. **Unattended Blockchains**: Blockchains integrating Omnilane have more venues to onboard TVL and users. They can offer cross-chain swaps and bridges to their users without the need to build the technology themselves, decentralizing the ecosystem and making it more robust.

4. **Wallet-as-a-service**: Wallet-as-a-service providers can integrate Omnilane in the backend and offer cross-chain swaps and bridges to their users. This will allow them to offer a better user experience and attract more users.
