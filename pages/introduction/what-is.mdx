# What is Omnilane?

## Introduction

Omnilane is [intent-based](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-labs-and-across-propose-standard-for-cross-chain-intents) decentralized infrastructure for swapping and bridging across any chain. Unlike traditional swap protocols, Omnilane doesnâ€™t have a frontend, instead, we focus on building the core infrastructure for cross-chain swaps and bridges so that other projects can leverage our technology to build or integrate within their own frontend applications.

We have developed a propietary algorithm called **Cumulative State Consensus** that leverages the innovative [Chain Signatures](https://docs.near.org/build/chain-abstraction/chain-signatures) technology on the NEAR blockchain and allows users to swap/bridge across chains without using oracles, bridges, sidechains, etc.

Any wallet, DEX, or dApp can integrate Omnilane in the backend, saving time and resources on building the best cross-chain swap tech and focusing on building the best user experience. Also, dApps that integrate Omnilane don't need to worry about gathering liquidity, as all the swap/bridge operations that go through Omnilane are settled by our liquidity providers.

Because of our superior decentralized technology, our low base fees, and our fair integration program, Omnilane is simply the best option for any project looking to integrate cross-chain swaps/bridges in their application.

## Examples of Integrations

1. **Wallets / Hardware Wallets**: Wallets often struggle monetizing their user base. By integrating Omnilane, they can offer seamless "Swap" or "Bridge" features, enabling users to perform cross-chain trades while earning a portion of the protocol fees. This creates a new revenue stream and enhances wallet functionality, driving user engagement.

2. **DEXes**: DEXes can integrate Omnilane as a backend solution to offer their users cross-chain swaps and bridging capabilities. This expands their service offerings, allowing them to monetize additional user activities. By enhancing the user experience with more robust cross-chain functionality, DEXes can attract and retain a broader audience.

3. **Unattended Blockchains**: Blockchains that partner with Omnilane add a powerful venue to onboard TVL and user base. By offering cross-chain swaps and bridging solutions without the need to develop the technology in-house, these blockchains contribute to a more decentralized and resilient ecosystem while expanding their functionality and reach.

4. **Wallet-as-a-service**: Providers offering wallet-as-a-service or key management solutions can integrate Omnilane into their SDKs, enabling cross-chain swaps and bridges for their clients. This integration opens new monetization avenues by capturing value from actions typically handled by external protocols, while also improving the user experience and driving customer acquisition.

5. **Bridge or Swap Aggregators:** Aggregators can integrate Omnilane to enhance their offering by providing users with access to cross-chain swaps and bridges across a wider range of networks. With Omnilane's chain-agnostic technology, aggregators can increase the liquidity sources available to their users and optimize for best execution. This allows aggregators to capture additional protocol fees while delivering an improved cross-chain trading experience, further differentiating themselves in the market.
