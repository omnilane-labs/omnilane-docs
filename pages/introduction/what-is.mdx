# What is Omnilane?

## Introduction

Omnilane is a decentralized cross-chain swap application leveraging the innovative Chain Signatures technology on the NEAR blockchain. This technology enables NEAR smart contracts to sign and execute transactions across various blockchains natively, without the need for intermediaries. By utilizing a MPC network, Omnilane provides a seamless, secure, and efficient swapping experience for users.

Omnilane's infrastructure is designed to be minimalistic, offering one of the fastest and most cost-effective solutions for cross-chain trading. The platform is chain agnostic, making it capable of addressing unattended markets across different blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, Omnilane's Request for Quote (RFQ) model ensures transparency and security by protecting against Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks, allowing users to know exactly what they will receive in their swaps.

## Use Cases

1. **Cross-Chain Swaps for Native Assets**: Omnilane enables users to swap native assets across different blockchains. This includes swapping assets like Bitcoin (BTC) from the Bitcoin network to other tokens on networks such as Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and more, all without relying on wrapped or synthetic versions of these assets.

2. **Unattended Market Opportunities**: The platform is particularly beneficial for markets that have been underserved by existing cross-chain solutions. By being chain agnostic, Omnilane can capture value in these markets, providing users with access to a broader range of digital assets and trading pairs.

3. **Security and Cost Efficiency**: Omnilane's minimalistic design not only reduces costs but also enhances transaction speed. This makes it an attractive option for users seeking a secure, low-cost, and fast trading experience across multiple blockchain networks.

## Example

Consider a user who wants to swap native BTC for a meme token on the Solana network. Traditional platforms might require wrapping the BTC, adding layers of complexity and potential risk. However, with Omnilane, the user can directly swap native BTC from the Bitcoin network to the desired token on the Solana network. The transaction is processed via the NEAR blockchain's settlement layer, leveraging Chain Signatures technology to ensure security and efficiency.

This straightforward process not only saves time and reduces costs but also provides users with peace of mind, knowing they are working with native assets in a secure environment. The transparency of the RFQ model means the user knows the exact outcome of the swap, free from unexpected slippage or MEV exploits.
