# Why

New blockchains emerge regularly, each designed for specific purposes. While this innovation brings tailored solutions to various industries and applications, it also introduces significant complexity for users. As blockchains become more specialized, the ecosystems they create become increasingly fragmented, leading to a disjointed user experience.

For users, this means having to navigate a growing number of chains, each with its own protocols, interfaces, and security mechanisms. What was once a relatively straightforward process of interacting with a single blockchain has become more complicated. Users now need to learn new skills, adapt to different environments, and manage various wallets or tools to interact seamlessly across chains. This can lead to confusion, errors, and even security risks, as users may struggle to stay up to date with each new blockchainâ€™s intricacies.


# How

Omnilane addresses this issue by abstracting the complexity of multi-chain interactions, providing an omni-chain layer of liquidity that allows users to interact across blockchains without leaving a footprint on costs, and speed.

Omnilane omni-chain liquidity layer can be used for bridging tokens quickly, swapping across chains, or interacting directly with a protocol on other blockchain: e.g repaying debt on AAVE on Ethereum with your native BTC.


## But What is Omnilane?

Omnilane is an [intent-based](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-labs-and-across-propose-standard-for-cross-chain-intents) decentralized infrastructure for swapping, bridging or operating across any chain.

We have developed a propietary algorithm called [**Cumulative State Consensus**](/protocol-overview/cumulative-state-consensus) that leverages the innovative [Chain Signatures](https://docs.near.org/build/chain-abstraction/chain-signatures) technology on the NEAR blockchain and allows users to operate across chains.

***The unique thing about Omnilane***, is that it operates without relying using oracles, bridges, sidechains, etc. This means that the Omnilane protocol provides the fastest and most efficient execution, and that it works on truly any chain (BTC, SOL, TRON, TON, etc).

Any wallet, DEX, or dApp can integrate Omnilane in the backend, increasing their reach, monetizing their userbase or attracting more users! See [some examples](/introduction/examples). Also, dApps that integrate Omnilane don't need to worry about gathering liquidity, as all the swap/bridge operations that go through Omnilane are settled by our liquidity providers.
