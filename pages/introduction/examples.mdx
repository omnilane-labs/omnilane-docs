## Examples of Integrations

Any dApp can integrate Omnilane's omni-chain liquidity layer in their interface and improve the experience for their users by allowing them use their tokens on any chain to operate in their protocol.

Here are a couple of examples of this.

1. **Wallets / Hardware Wallets**: Wallets often struggle monetizing their user base. By integrating Omnilane, they can offer seamless "Swap" or "Bridge" features, enabling users to perform cross-chain trades while earning a portion of the protocol fees. This creates a new revenue stream and enhances wallet functionality, driving user engagement.

2. **DEXes**: DEXes can integrate Omnilane as a backend solution to offer their users cross-chain swaps and bridging capabilities. This expands their service offerings, allowing them to monetize additional user activities. By enhancing the user experience with more robust cross-chain functionality, DEXes can attract and retain a broader audience.

3. **dApps such as Lending Protocols**: Lending protocols can integrate Omnilane to allow users to repay debt with tokens on any chain. This enables users to supply assets on any chain, increasing the protocol's liquidity and volume. By expanding the reach of their services, lending protocols can capture additional fees and grow their user base.

4. **Unattended Blockchains**: Blockchains that partner with Omnilane add a powerful venue to onboard TVL and user base. By offering cross-chain swaps and bridging solutions without the need to develop the technology in-house, these blockchains contribute to a more decentralized and resilient ecosystem while expanding their functionality and reach.

4. **Wallet-as-a-service**: Providers offering wallet-as-a-service or key management solutions can integrate Omnilane into their SDKs, enabling cross-chain swaps and bridges for their clients. This integration opens new monetization avenues by capturing value from actions typically handled by external protocols, while also improving the user experience and driving customer acquisition.

5. **Bridge or Swap Aggregators:** Aggregators can integrate Omnilane to enhance their offering by providing users with access to cross-chain swaps and bridges across a wider range of networks. With Omnilane's chain-agnostic technology, aggregators can increase the liquidity sources available to their users and optimize for best execution. This allows aggregators to capture additional protocol fees while delivering an improved cross-chain trading experience, further differentiating themselves in the market.

6. **Token Issuers (RWA, Stablecoins, etc)**: Token issuers can use Omnilane to issue their tokens across any chain, expanding their reach and utility.
