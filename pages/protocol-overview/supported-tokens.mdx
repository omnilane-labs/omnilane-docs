# Protocol Overview

## Supported Tokens

Omnilane's technology is designed to support a wide range of digital assets, including tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This flexibility allows users to trade a diverse array of assets across different blockchain networks.

Currently, Omnilane focuses on supporting a select group of ERC-20 tokens, providing users with access to popular and widely used digital assets. Our platform is designed to expand its supported tokens based on our strategic roadmap and user demand. This approach ensures that we can adapt to the evolving needs of the digital asset market while maintaining a secure and efficient trading environment.

As Omnilane continues to grow, we plan to integrate additional tokens and asset types, further enhancing the versatility and appeal of our platform for traders and collectors alike.
