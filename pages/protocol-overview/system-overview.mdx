# Protocol Overview

Omnilane is an [intent-based](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-labs-and-across-propose-standard-for-cross-chain-intents) decentralized cross-chain swap protocol that enables the seamless exchange of native digital assets across multiple blockchain networks.
Below, an overview of how Omnilane works and the different components that make it possible.

## System Overview

**Chain Signatures Technology**

Omnilane leverages [Chain Signatures](https://docs.near.org/build/chain-abstraction/chain-signatures), a built-in [MPC](https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/) network on the NEAR blockchain that allow NEAR smart-contracts to derive private keys and sign transactions using different cryptographic curves.

**NEAR as Ledger Layer**

Omnilane ledger smart-contracts live on the NEAR blockchain, using it as its settlement layer for its fast blocktime, its efficiency in transaction costs and scalable infrastructure to process transactions. NEAR's sharding technology enables high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for handling the demands of cross-chain swaps.
The main protocol's smart contracts are deployed on NEAR, where we execute the logic for executing swaps, handling fees, and ensuring that transactions are completed as intended.

This doesn't necessarily mean users need to interact with NEAR. Transactions are sponsored by Omnilane as the default relayer, allowing for a seamless experience.

**Intent-Based Limit Orders**

Omnilane only needs to deploy a smart-contract on new blockchains to integrate. These smart-contracts will accept deposits to create new swap orders from users. 

Along with the deposit, users provide _**witness of counterparty cumulative liquidity**_, which later works as proof to settle the trade without requiring any further action from the user.

**Cumulative State Consensus**

The Cumulative State Consensus, is a peer-to-peer consensus of the cumulative deposits made by a trade counterparty. This is provided by users creating new orders along with their deposit. Because all liabilities are tracked on the Ledger Layer, having the acknowledgment from the user of the cumulative liquidity deposited by their chosen counterparties allows for the NEAR smart-contracts to determine whether the trade can take place or not (if the counterparty is solvent for settling the trade securely.)

Please note that this makes it possible for Omnilane to operate without oracles, sidechains, or bridges, allowing us to scale quickly.
