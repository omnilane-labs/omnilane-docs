# Protocol Overview

Omnilane is a decentralized, [intent-based](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-labs-and-across-propose-standard-for-cross-chain-intents) liquidity protocol designed to facilitate seamless interactions across multiple blockchains. By abstracting away the complexity of cross-chain swaps and liquidity management, Omnilane enables fast, secure, and scalable asset transfers. The protocol operates through three key layers:

Protocol Smart Contracts on Each Chain
These smart contracts are deployed across multiple blockchains to facilitate deposits, execute swaps, and manage orders without intermediaries.

Network of Solvers
A decentralized network of solvers competes to fulfill cross-chain operations, executing actions for a fee and ensuring liquidity across chains.

Integration with dApps
Omnilane integrates seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets, allowing them to tap into omnichain liquidity without needing to manage infrastructure or liquidity pools themselves.

## System Overview

**Chain Signatures Technology**

Omnilane leverages [Chain Signatures](https://docs.near.org/build/chain-abstraction/chain-signatures), a built-in [MPC](https://www.fireblocks.com/what-is-mpc/) network on the NEAR blockchain that allow NEAR smart-contracts to derive private keys and sign transactions using different cryptographic curves.

**NEAR as Ledger Layer**

The backbone of Omnilane is its ledger smart contracts, which reside on the NEAR blockchain. NEAR serves as the settlement layer due to its fast block times, efficient transaction costs, and scalable sharding infrastructure. This makes NEAR ideal for managing high-throughput and low-latency transactions. The core logic for swaps, fee handling, and transaction finality is executed here. 

Importantly, users do not need to directly interact with NEAR, as Omnilane sponsors transactions as the default relayer, providing a smooth, user-friendly experience.

**Intent-Based Limit Orders**

Omnilane only needs to deploy smart contracts on new blockchains to integrate them into the system. These contracts allow users to deposit assets and create new swap orders. 

When creating an order, users also provide proof of cumulative liquidity from a counterpart, which serves as a witness to settle the trade without any additional actions required from the user.

**Cumulative State Consensus**

The Cumulative State Consensus mechanism underpins Omnilaneâ€™s secure and efficient cross-chain swaps. This peer-to-peer consensus model tracks the cumulative deposits made by counterparties in a trade. Users provide acknowledgment of their counterparties' cumulative liquidity, allowing NEAR smart contracts to determine whether a trade can proceed based on solvency. Since Omnilane tracks all liabilities on the NEAR ledger layer, it can operate without the need for oracles, sidechains, or bridges, ensuring both scalability and security.
