# Integration Example

## Visual Example
You can check an example of how to integrate Omnilane in your application by visiting the [Omnilane Dapp Example](https://showcase.omnilane.xyz/).

Or by watching our showcase video:

## Code
The following is pseudo code that shows how to integrate Omnilane in your application. This code is a simplified version of the integration process, and it may not work as is.

### Get quotes
```javascript
const response = http.get(
    BROKER_URL + "/quotes",
    { 
      params: {
        fromChain: fromChain.chainId,
        fromAsset: fromAsset.label, // Token ticker e.g USDT
        toChain: toChain.chainId, 
        toAsset: toAsset.label, // // Token ticker e.g USDT
        amountIn: amountIn,
      } 
    }
);
```

This will result in a response like the following

```javascript
const intent = {
  "amountIn": "10000000",
  "broadcastFee": "2213090",
  "fromAsset": {
    "id": "USDT",
    "chainId": 31337,
    "decimals": 6,
    "contractAddress": "0xa7465d0d78d81bd8a51b47b2cdfc6bdff474db47",
    "vaultContractAddress": "0x260bd0d51347ddc044bbe2dbc5dd69deae604c08"
  },
  "toAsset": {
    "id": "USDT",
    "chainId": 31337,
    "decimals": 6,
    "contractAddress": "0xa7465d0d78d81bd8a51b47b2cdfc6bdff474db47",
    "vaultContractAddress": "0x260bd0d51347ddc044bbe2dbc5dd69deae604c08"
  },
  "witnessedCumulatives": [
    {
      "marketMaker": "0x1ca6947022d54f3a55bd465101e3bf7fc3dd0db3",
      "witness": "10000000000"
    },
    {
      "marketMaker": "0xab926fe0c90bb4a761feda2c93bb44f2517684e6",
      "witness": "10000000000"
    }
  ],
  "quotes": [
    {
      "amountOut": "10000000"
    },
    {
      "amountOut": "10000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

This has all the information required to now post an order to the vault on the origin chain.

The quotes array, is the quote for the amountIn you provided, provided by the liquidity providers in the omnilane network. This may differ from the price in coinmarketcap.

These work only as reference to know the current price at which assets are likely to be paid.

Note that this is only a facility provided by Omnilane to facilitate the integration process. You can get all this information by yourself with onchain data.

### Posting an order
Before posting an order, you need to approve the vault contract to spend the amount of the asset you are swapping.

After that, you can post an order to the vault contract on the origin chain.

```javascript
orderParams = {
    ...intent,
    partnerId: "0xab926fe0c90bb4a761feda2c93bb44f2517684e6", // If you joined the partner program, specify your ID to receive the partner fees
    vendorId: "0x1ca6947022d54f3a55bd465101e3bf7fc3dd0db3", // The address where you will receive the fees
    vendorFeeBps: 100, // The amount of vendor fees you want to charge
    minAmountOut: median(intent.quotes) // this is only an example of how to calculate the minAmountOut
}


vaultContract = instantiateContract(originBlockchain.vaultContractAddress, VAULT_BUILD.abi);

requestId = vaultContract.validateOrder(orderParams, intent.toAsset.contractAddress); // Obtain the request ID for the order

tx = vaultContract.postOrder(orderParams, requestId, address, intent.toAsset.contractAddress); // post the order to the vault contract

receipt = getTransactionReceipt(tx);
newOrder = receipt.logs.find("NewOrder")

orderId = newOrder.orderId;    
```

### Fetching the status of an order

In order to know if a limit order has been picked by a liquidity provider, you can call the `get_order_status` view function in the core smart contract in NEAR.

```javascript
import NearApi from "near-api-js";

NEAR_CONFIG = {
    rpc: "https://rpc.testnet.near.org",
    ...
    ...
}

nearConnection = NearApi.connect(NEAR_CONFIG);

contract = new Contract(CORE_NEAR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, {
    viewMethods: ["get_order_status"], 
    changeMethods: [], 
});

result = contract.get_order_status({ order_id: byteArrayFromHexString(orderId) });

if (result === 'Settled') {
    success()
}
```

To know if the funds have already been released, you can call the `get_order_status` view function in the core smart contract in NEAR.

```javascript
const destinationVaultContract = instantiateContract(destinationBlockchain.vaultContractAddress, ["function claimedOrders(bytes32) view returns (bool)"]);
const isClaimed = destinationVaultContract.claimedOrders(orderId);
```
