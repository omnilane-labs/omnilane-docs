# Build on Top of Omnilane

Omnilane can be used as the base layer for truly chain abstracted applications, allowing builders to focus on innovating without barriers, Rather than focusing on looking for liquidity or building complex cross-chain infrastructure.

Here are a couple of examples of what you can build on top of Omnilane:

## Cross-Chain Investment Hub
A cross-chain investment hub allows users to explore and invest in opportunities from any blockchain, seamlessly diversifying portfolios without needing to worry about blockchain compatibility. Whether it’s yield farming, staking, or investing in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), this hub allows users to move funds and capture opportunities wherever they are.
- Users can browse investment opportunities across chains (e.g., lending on Aave on Ethereum, staking on Solana, yield farming on Avalanche).
- Omnilane manages the cross-chain asset transfers and allocation of funds to the right platform, ensuring seamless participation in opportunities from any blockchain.
- Users can track their investments and returns in a unified dashboard, even if they are spread across multiple chains.

## Cross-Chain Token Launchpad
A cross-chain token launchpad enables users to participate in token sales and fundraising events across multiple blockchains, allowing projects to raise funds from a broader audience without being limited to a single chain. This launchpad uses Omnilane’s technology to allow for token purchases from any chain, offering users flexibility in how they contribute to new projects.

- Projects launch their token sales on the platform, allowing contributions from any supported blockchain.
- Users can buy tokens from their preferred blockchain, and Omnilane facilitates the cross-chain transaction, converting the contribution to the project’s target blockchain.
- Tokens are automatically distributed across chains based on user participation, with Omnilane handling the asset transfers and distributions securely.

## Cross Chain Swap

A decentralized, cross-chain swap service enables users to exchange assets from one blockchain to another with minimal friction. Unlike traditional swaps limited to a single blockchain, this platform would allow for native asset swapping across chains, utilizing Omnilane’s infrastructure for fast and cost-effective transactions.

- Users initiate a swap of native assets from one blockchain (e.g., ETH to BNB).
- Omnilane handles the cross-chain communication and signature verification, ensuring secure and atomic swaps without needing multiple intermediaries.
- Once validated, the swapped assets are delivered to the user’s wallet on the target chain, maintaining full control over funds throughout the process.

## Bridge
A cross-chain bridge powered by Omnilane enables the secure transfer of assets and data between different blockchains. This infrastructure allows for seamless movement of tokens, NFTs, and other assets across various ecosystems, ensuring users can interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on any chain without friction.
- Users select the asset and source blockchain.
- Omnilane verifies the transaction and ensures that equivalent assets are minted or unlocked on the target chain while securely locking or burning the original on the source chain.
- This process happens trustlessly, with Omnilane’s technology ensuring no double-spending or asset loss.

## DeFi Hub

A centralized platform where users can access all major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols across various blockchains. This DeFi Hub would allow users to swap, lend, borrow, and stake assets across multiple ecosystems without having to leave a single interface.

- Integrate various DeFi protocols from multiple chains into one unified interface.
- Users can access liquidity pools, lending protocols, and staking opportunities from Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and others through Omnilane’s cross-chain infrastructure.
- The hub provides one-click access to services across chains, with Omnilane facilitating the cross-chain asset movements and transactions.
