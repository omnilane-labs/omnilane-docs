# F.A.Q

Welcome to the Omnilane Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q) page. Here, you'll find answers to some of the most common questions about our platform, technology, and services. If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to our support team.

## What is Omnilane?

Omnilane is a decentralized cross-chain swap application that enables users to trade native assets across different blockchain networks. Leveraging NEAR's Chain Signatures technology, Omnilane provides a seamless, secure, and efficient platform for asset exchange without the need for intermediaries or wrapped tokens.

## How does Omnilane work?

Omnilane uses Chain Signatures technology on the NEAR blockchain to facilitate cross-chain transactions. This allows NEAR smart contracts to sign and execute transactions across various blockchains natively. Users can swap native assets directly from one blockchain to another, with all transactions settled on the NEAR blockchain.

## What are the benefits of using Omnilane?

Omnilane offers several advantages, including:
- **Native asset swaps**: Trade native assets without relying on wrapped or synthetic tokens.
- **Security**: Protects against MEV attacks and other vulnerabilities.
- **Cost efficiency**: Minimal infrastructure results in lower transaction fees.
- **Speed**: Fast transaction processing thanks to NEAR's scalable infrastructure.
- **User control**: Users retain full control over their assets during transactions.

## What is the Request for Quote (RFQ) model?

The RFQ model is a trading mechanism used by Omnilane to ensure transparency and fairness in transactions. In this model, users receive a quote for their swap before executing the trade, knowing exactly what they will receive in exchange. This model helps prevent unexpected slippage and MEV exploits.

## What blockchains are supported by Omnilane?

Omnilane is chain agnostic and supports multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and more. We continually work to expand our support to additional networks to provide users with access to a wide range of digital assets.

## Is Omnilane secure?

Yes, Omnilane prioritizes security through the use of decentralized technology and secure transaction methods. Our use of Chain Signatures technology, combined with the RFQ model, ensures that users' assets and transactions are protected from common vulnerabilities.

## How can I start using Omnilane?

To start using Omnilane, simply connect your cryptocurrency wallet to our platform. You can then initiate cross-chain swaps by selecting the assets you wish to trade and confirming the transaction. Our platform will guide you through the process, ensuring a smooth and secure experience.

## What fees does Omnilane charge?

Omnilane charges minimal fees for transactions, making it one of the most cost-effective options for cross-chain swaps. Fees vary depending on the specific transaction and network conditions. We are committed to maintaining transparency in our fee structure, ensuring users are fully informed before executing trades.

## How does Omnilane handle user data?

Omnilane values user privacy and does not require personal information for transactions. As a decentralized platform, we do not hold or store user assets or data, further enhancing the security and privacy of our users.
