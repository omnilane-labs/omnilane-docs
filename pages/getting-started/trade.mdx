### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

2. **Connect Wallet**: Click on the "Connect Wallet" button and choose your preferred wallet (e.g., MetaMask, NEAR Wallet).
3. **Authorize Connection**: Follow the instructions to authorize the connection between your wallet and Omnilane.

### Step 2: Select Assets for Swap

1. **Choose Trading Pair**: Select the assets you wish to swap (e.g., BTC to ETH).
2. **Enter Amount**: Specify the amount of the asset you want to swap.

### Step 3: Review and Confirm

1. **Request Quote**: Click "Request Quote" to get a guaranteed rate for your swap, which specifies the exact amount you will receive.
2. **Review Details**: Check the swap details, including the rate and any fees.
3. **Create Virtual Order**: Confirm the swap to create a "Virtual Order." This involves signing a transaction with your wallet, indicating your intent to proceed with the swap.

### Step 4: Deposit Tokens

1. **Deposit Instructions**: Deposit the specified tokens into the Omnilane smart contract as per the instructions provided.
2. **Await Confirmation**: The platform will acknowledge the receipt of your tokens and begin processing the swap.

### Step 5: Token Allocation and Confirmation

1. **Set Apart Tokens**: On the destination chain, Omnilane sets apart the equivalent amount of tokens for your trade.
2. **Witness Signature**: You will be prompted to confirm that these tokens have been set apart successfully for you on the destination chain. This is done by providing a "witness signature," which verifies that the tokens are ready to be received.

### Step 6: Finalize the Swap

1. **Release Tokens**: After receiving your witness signature, Omnilane completes the transaction by releasing the allocated tokens to your wallet on the destination chain.
2. **Receive Assets**: The swapped assets are then available in your wallet, completing the cross-chain transaction.
