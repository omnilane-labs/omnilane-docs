# Getting Started

## Market Makers

Market makers play a critical role in providing liquidity and ensuring efficient trades on Omnilane. Currently, market makers are permissioned, and interested parties must contact us to join the program. If you're interested in becoming a market maker, please [reach out to us](mailto:franco@omnilane.xyz).

### Requirements and Responsibilities

1. **Stake for Reputation**
   - **Stake Requirement**: Market makers are required to put up a stake, which acts as a reputation bond. This stake is a guarantee of their commitment to settle trades promptly.
   - **Benefits**: By staking, market makers receive reduced trading fees. This provides an incentive for maintaining a high-quality service.
   - **Penalty**: If a market maker fails to settle a trade within the agreed time with the user, their stake may be slashed as a penalty.

2. **Integration with Omnilane WebSocket System**
   - **Real-Time Data Access**: Market makers must integrate with Omnilaneâ€™s WebSocket system, which broadcasts user trade requests in real time.
   - **Bid Submission**: To participate, market makers need to listen to trade broadcasts and submit signed quotes for the trades they wish to bid on.

3. **Signed Quotes**
   - **Quote Submission**: When bidding on a trade, market makers provide a signed quote indicating the terms of the trade, including the price and amount.
   - **User Acceptance**: The user may choose to accept or reject the quote. If accepted, the user will be prompted to deposit the necessary tokens.

4. **Trade Settlement**
   - **User Deposit**: After a user deposits the tokens, market makers must provide a signature witnessing the deposit, confirming that the tokens have been received as agreed.
   - **Finalization**: Upon verification, the trade is settled according to the agreed terms, completing the transaction.

5. **Incentivized Pairs**
   - **Incentives for Liquidity**: Market makers who provide liquidity for specific trading pairs that Omnilane is incentivizing can benefit from further reduced fees. This encourages liquidity provision in targeted areas, enhancing overall market efficiency.
