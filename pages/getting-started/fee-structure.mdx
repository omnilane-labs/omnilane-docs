# KPIs

KPIs are a set of metrics tracked at the settlement layer (NEAR) to evaluate market maker performance. These KPIs influence the fee structure and potentially provide additional benefits. Market makers who comply with these KPIs can receive discounts on trading fees and may even earn rebates or extra profit on trades. The KPIs are tracked daily and play a crucial role in maintaining a fair and efficient market.

| **KPI**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Trading Volume**          | Market makers are placed on a tiered fee structure based on their trading volume. Higher volumes result in lower fees, rewarding market makers for increased activity.                            |
| **Failed Trades**           | Committing to a trade and then pulling out results in severe penalties. This KPI ensures that market makers maintain reliability and integrity in their trading commitments.                        |
| **Price Accuracy**          | When a quote is requested, an index price is provided. If a trade is settled with a significant deviation from this index price, the market maker's score is lowered. Accurate pricing helps maintain market integrity. |

Compliance with these KPIs not only reduces trading fees for market makers but also offers the potential for additional rewards, such as rebates or extra profit on trades. This system incentivizes high performance and reliability, contributing to a stable and trustworthy trading environment on Omnilane.
